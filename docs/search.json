    "text": "Preface\nWorkshop date: February 18th, 5:30-7pm\nLocation: Virtual (R-Ladies webinar)\nInstructors: Jessica Bolin, Nerea Lezama Ochoa\nR is undoubtedly the programming language of choice for many marine ecologists. However, navigating the complexities of downloading, processing and wrangling gridded oceanographic data within R can represent a steep learning curve. As climate-related projects continue to receive funding and the impacts of climate variability and change on our oceans become increasingly evident, the ability to efficiently interact with, and use, Earth System Model (ESM) outputs for our research is more critical than ever.\nThe aim of this workshop is to train researchers in skills needed to be proficient in creating projections of physical variables from ESM outputs, with the goal of using them for ecological applications. Specifically, we’ll be creating projections of sea-surface temperature across two time periods out to 2100, across two climate scenarios, for the California Current region.\nOur workshop is designed around Step 8 (pre-process the data) in the workflow of best practices for using ESMs for marine ecologists, as defined in Figure 1 within (Schoeman et al. 2023).",

While participants don’t need to be highly proficient, a basic understanding of R and programming syntax is required. For example, participants should know how to create an R project and open a script, read in data using commands, make basic plots using base R, and write for loops. A basic understanding of the shell/command line is advantageous, but not required. Further, previous experience using the terra package and working with netCDF files is a plus, but again, not required.\nIn addition to having R and RStudio already installed, you will need to install (i) CDO, (ii) NCO, (iii) wget, (iv) Panoply and (v) a suite of R packages.",

    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nWe strongly recommend using a macOS laptop for the workshop. We’ve found that Windows users can run into issues with installing and using CDO, which is required for the workshop (see below).\nTo see if you may have software issues during our workshop, install the prerequisites below, download this folder here, and run the runme.R script. If you don’t run into any errors, great! If you do, you will need to do some troubleshooting before the workshop.\n\n\n\n\nCDO\nYou will need CDO (Climate Data Operators) installed prior to the workshop. CDO comprises a suite of over 600 operators for standard (and speedy) processing of climate and forecast model outputs. More information on CDO found here.\n\nMacOS\nThe simplest way to install CDO is via Homebrew. If you haven’t already installed Homebrew, do so here. Then, open terminal and run the following code:\n\nbrew install cdo\n\nMore information available on the CDO MacOS website.\n\n\nWindows\nCDO is meant for use on POSIX-compatible operating systems (e.g., like Linux and MacOS), so downloading on Windows requires some extra steps.\nRecent versions of Windows (&gt;=10) includes an Ubuntu embedded Linux, offering the opportunity to install CDO via Ubuntu’s native package manager. First, install the Ubuntu app from the Microsoft Store application. Then open the Ubuntu terminal and type:\n\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install cdo #write your password, if prompted\n\nMore information available on the CDO Windows website.\n\n\n\n\nNCO\nSimilar to CDO, we will install NCO (netCDF operators), which are a suite of operators that take netCDF file formats and facilitate file manipulation.\n\nMac\n\nbrew install nco\n\n\n\nWindows\nInstalling NCO on windows can be tricky. Here is a discussion forum.\n\n\n\n\nwget\nwget is a bash command used for downloading files from the internet. We will use this to download our ESMs via wget scripts from the ESGF website.\n\nmacOS\nRun the following in terminal:\n\nbrew install wget\n\n\n\nWindows\nCheck out the link here. You may need to do some extra fiddling - see here or check out Youtube for further help.\n\n\n\n\nPanoply\nPanoply is a data viewer for netCDF, HDF and GRIB data arrays, administered by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Panoply requires that your computer has a compatible Java 11 (or later version) JRE or JDK installed.\nDownload Panoply here.\n\n\n\nR Packages\nEnsure you have the following R packages installed, listed below.\n\n#Install pacman \nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\") \n\n# Install packages, if not already installed \npacman::p_load(tidyverse, # Working with 'tidy' data\n               furrr, parallelly, purrr, # Run functions in parallel\n               tictoc, beepr, # Understand code execution time \n               ncdf4, raster, terra, # For working with netCDFs\n               tmap, # Map visualization \n               plotrix, # Taylor Diagrams\n               RCurl, xml2, rvest, # Downloading files \n               zoo) \n\n\n\n\nChanging your path\nLastly, once you have downloaded the repository, you will need to open __scripts/helpers.R, and change your pth object to suit your machine (see Line 7). I’ve set mine as \"/Users/admin/Documents/GitHub/esmRworkshop_rladies26\"; change yours to reflect where this folder is located on your machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are the dependencies and package

A full list of CMIP6 experiments can be found here.\nNot all modeling centers run the same experiments in their ESMs. However, each ESM contains the historical simulation, where the ESM is run over the historical period, defined as 1850-2014. The historical runs are not fit to observed data, but rather, emerge from the physics of the model. This allows modelers to run hindcasts of the model (i.e., predictions of past climate), which are then compared to recorded climate observations. If the hindcasts are good at simulating observed reality, this gives modelers more confidence in the model projections.\nAnother set of experiments are future warming scenarios, termed SSPs, which are detailed below.",

These are just for two models and two scenarios + historical, at a monthly time-step. Storing ESM outputs can take a lot of space - for example, if you’re working with daily data across multiple models and climate scenarios, you’ll almost certainly need an external hard drive or other storage solution.\n\n\n\nWe will use wget to download our files from the ESGF Metagrid.\n\n2.3.1 Define dependencies\nFirst, we source our packages and set our directories for where our (i) wget scripts are stored, and (ii) where we will store the ESM outputs.\n\nsource(paste0(getwd(), \"/__scripts/helpers.R\"))\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Prepare for parallel processing\nWe are harnessing the power of parallel processing to download our ESM outputs. We use availableCores() from the parallelly package to tell us how many available cores we have on our machine. I recommend to use whatever the output is minus two, so that your operating system and other background processes can continue working normally. I have 16 cores on my machine, so I’ll use 14 workers.\n\nparallelly::availableCores() # Output says I have 16 cores on my machine\nw &lt;- 14  # Leave two cores for other background processes\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Function to download files\nNow, we write a function that uses the system() function to invoke the terminal from within R to run the wget script, which downloads the ESM file. First, we set our working directory to the full path where data will be stored, which we defined above as /data. Then, we run the system() function to run the wget script using bash via the terminal. Once the script has run and the file has downloaded, we set the working directory back to the root directory.\n\nwget_files &lt;- function(script) {\n  setwd(paste0(pth, cmip_pth)) #set directory to where data will be stored\n  system(paste0(\"bash \", script, \" -s\")) #run wget on the shell script \n  setwd(pth) #set directory back to home directory \n}\n\nHere, we list all wget scripts that we downloaded from ESGF.\n\nfiles &lt;- list.files(paste0(pth, wget_pth), #full path where wget scripts are stored\n                    pattern = \"wget\", #only files with wget in the name\n                    full.names = TRUE #list the full path \n                    ) \nfiles\n\n[1] \"/Users/admin/Documents/GitHub/esmrworkshop_rladies26/__scripts/wget_scripts/wget_script_2026-2-4_12-13-19.sh\"\n[2] \"/Users/admin/Documents/GitHub/esmrworkshop_rladies26/__scripts/wget_scripts/wget_script_2026-2-4_12-14-23.sh\"\n[3] \"/Users/admin/Documents/GitHub/esmrworkshop_rladies26/__scripts/wget_scripts/wget_script_2026-2-4_12-16-43.sh\"\n[4] \"/Users/admin/Documents/GitHub/esmrworkshop_rladies26/__scripts/wget_scripts/wget_script_2026-2-4_12-16-6.sh\" \n[5] \"/Users/admin/Documents/GitHub/esmrworkshop_rladies26/__scripts/wget_scripts/wget_script_2026-2-4_12-17-4.sh\" \n[6] \"/Users/admin/Documents/GitHub/esmrworkshop_rladies26/__scripts/wget_scripts/wget_script_2026-2-4_12-5-32.sh\" \n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Run function in parallel\nNow, we change to multi-session processing, where multiple workers (sessions) are used to download the files concurrently. We then run the wget_files() function with future_walk() , and use the tictoc package to time how long this takes. Once all files have downloaded, we change back to single-threaded processing.\n\nplan(multisession, workers = w) # Change to multi-threaded processing\ntic(); future_walk(files, wget_files); toc() #Run the function in parallel\nplan(sequential) # Return to single threaded processing (i.e., sequential/normal)\n\n\nJessie speed: 30s to 1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload speeds\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload speeds depend on your Wifi connection, the capabilities of your local machine, and the performance of the server/node you’re attempting to connect to. You can check whether ESGF servers are online here.\n\n\n\nWe can check the files have downloaded by…\n\nlist.files(paste0(pth, cmip_pth))\n\n[1] \"tos_Omon_ACCESS-CM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc\"  \n[2] \"tos_Omon_ACCESS-CM2_ssp245_r1i1p1f1_gn_201501-210012.nc\"      \n[3] \"tos_Omon_ACCESS-CM2_ssp585_r1i1p1f1_gn_201501-210012.nc\"      \n[4] \"tos_Omon_IPSL-CM6A-LR_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc\"\n[5] \"tos_Omon_IPSL-CM6A-LR_ssp245_r1i1p1f1_gn_201501-210012.nc\"    \n[6] \"tos_Omon_IPSL-CM6A-LR_ssp585_r1i1p1f1_gn_201501-210012.nc\"    \n\n\nGreat! We have successfully downloaded our ESM outputs.\nIf your scripts have downloaded data for 2100-2300 (i.e., some models will do this), we can remove those files with the rm argument in shell:\n\nsystem(paste0(\"rm \", pth, cmip_pth, \"/\", \n              \"tos_Omon_ACCESS-CM2_ssp585_r1i1p1f1_gn_210101-230012.nc\"))\nsystem(paste0(\"rm \", pth, cmip_pth, \"/\", \n              \"tos_Omon_IPSL-CM6A-LR_ssp585_r1i1p1f1_gn_210101-230012.nc\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeware of rm\n\n\n\n\n\nrm is a handy function for removing files, but there is no way of retrieving them if you’ve accidentally removed the wrong file. So, use this function wisely and make sure you’re 100% confident you’re removing the correct file!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchoeman, David S., Alex Sen Gupta, Cheryl S. Harrison, Jason D.

The most common remapping ‘method’ between grids with spherical coordinates is with bilinear interpolation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nYou can also use first order conservative remapping if bilinear interpolation fails (which may occur if the input grid is ‘unstructured’ as opposed to ‘spherical’).\n\n\nFirst, let’s inspect the metadata associated with our source input file using terra\n\nrr\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \nsize        : 300, 360, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 1, 1  (x, y)\nextent      : -0.5, 359.5, -0.5, 299.5  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. :  \nsource      : tos_Omon_ACCESS-CM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc:tos \nvarname     : tos (Sea Surface Temperature) \nname        : tos_1 \nunit        :  degC \ntime (days) : 1850-01-16 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also check more detailed metadata contained in the ESM file using ncdf4::nc_open()\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives you the same information after reading a file into Panoply.\n\nnc &lt;- nc_open(paste0(pth, cmip_pth, \"/tos_Omon_ACCESS-CM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc\"))\nnc\n\nFile /Users/admin/Documents/GitHub/esmrworkshop_rladies26/__data/cmip6_raw/tos_Omon_ACCESS-CM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc (NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4_CLASSIC):\n\n     6 variables (excluding dimension variables):\n        double time_bnds[bnds,time]   (Chunking: [2,1])  (Compression: level 1)\n        double latitude[i,j]   (Chunking: [360,300])  (Compression: level 1)\n            standard_name: latitude\n            long_name: latitude\n            units: degrees_north\n            missing_value: 1e+20\n            _FillValue: 1e+20\n            bounds: vertices_latitude\n        double longitude[i,j]   (Chunking: [360,300])  (Compression: level 1)\n            standard_name: longitude\n            long_name: longitude\n            units: degrees_east\n            missing_value: 1e+20\n            _FillValue: 1e+20\n            bounds: vertices_longitude\n        double vertices_latitude[vertices,i,j]   (Chunking: [2,360,300])  (Compression: level 1)\n            units: degrees_north\n            missing_value: 1e+20\n            _FillValue: 1e+20\n        double vertices_longitude[vertices,i,j]   (Chunking: [2,360,300])  (Compression: level 1)\n            units: degrees_east\n            missing_value: 1e+20\n            _FillValue: 1e+20\n        float tos[i,j,time]   (Chunking: [360,300,1])  (Compression: level 1)\n            standard_name: sea_surface_temperature\n            long_name: Sea Surface Temperature\n            comment: Temperature of upper boundary of the liquid ocean, including temperatures below sea-ice and floating ice shelves.\n            units: degC\n            cell_methods: area: mean where sea time: mean\n            cell_measures: area: areacello\n            history: 2019-11-08T18:45:39Z altered by CMOR: replaced missing value flag (-1e+20) with standard missing value (1e+20).\n            missing_value: 1.00000002004088e+20\n            _FillValue: 1.00000002004088e+20\n            coordinates: latitude longitude\n\n     5 dimensions:\n        time  Size:1980   *** is unlimited *** \n            bounds: time_bnds\n            units: days since 1850-01-01\n            calendar: proleptic_gregorian\n            axis: T\n            long_name: time\n            standard_name: time\n        j  Size:300 \n            units: 1\n            long_name: cell index along second dimension\n        i  Size:360 \n            units: 1\n            long_name: cell index along first dimension\n        bnds  Size:2 (no dimvar)\n        vertices  Size:4 (no dimvar)\n\n    47 global attributes:\n        Conventions: CF-1.7 CMIP-6.2\n        activity_id: CMIP\n        branch_method: standard\n        branch_time_in_child: 0\n        branch_time_in_parent: 0\n        creation_date: 2019-11-08T18:45:44Z\n        data_specs_version: 01.00.30\n        experiment: all-forcing simulation of the recent past\n        experiment_id: historical\n        external_variables: areacello\n        forcing_index: 1\n        frequency: mon\n        further_info_url: https://furtherinfo.es-doc.org/CMIP6.CSIRO-ARCCSS.ACCESS-CM2.historical.none.r1i1p1f1\n        grid: native atmosphere N96 grid (144x192 latxlon)\n        grid_label: gn\n        history: 2019-11-08T18:45:44Z ;

Let’s remap the file so it conforms to -180 to 180˚ lat/lon, crops the extent to the ocean off California, and changes the resolution to 0.25˚ to match the resolution of an observational data product we’ll be using in the next step (i.e., OISST for bias correction). Very important to note here that we’re not ‘increasing’ the resolution of our product, per se - we’re not gaining any data here, we’re just remapping the ESM to a finer resolution.\n\n\n3.2.1 A (brief) intro to CDO\nCDO provides a wide range of functions and operators for processing and analyzing climate data in netCDF format. CDO syntax is quite simple. CDO is often deployed through the terminal/shell. A basic line of code looks like:\ncdo -operator input_file/s output_file/s\nWhere we: (i) call cdo, (ii) specify the operator, (iii) define the input file/s, (iv) define the output file/s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon CDO operators\n\n\n\n\n\ncdo -yearmean calculates the annual mean of a monthly data input netCDF file\ncdo -yearmin calculates the annual min of a monthly data input netCDF file\ncdo -yearmax calculates the annual max of a monthly data input netCDF file\ncdo -ensmean calculates the ensemble mean of several netCDF files. If your input files are different models, this function will estimate a mean of all those models\ncdo -vertmean calculates the vertical mean for netCDF with olevel (i.e., depth)\ncdo -mergetime merge all the netCDF files in your directory\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Remapping with CDO and R\nHere, we define a function that leverages the power of CDO from within our R environment (as opposed through the terminal/shell).\n\nremap_n_crop_temp &lt;- function(nc_file,\n                              cell_res = 0.25, \n                              infold = paste0(pth, cmip_pth), \n                              outfold = paste0(pth, cmip_pth_proc),\n                              xmin = -126, xmax = -115, ymin = 32, ymax = 43) {\n  \n  system(paste0(\"cdo -L -sellonlatbox,\", xmin, \",\", xmax, \",\", ymin, \",\", ymax,  \n                \" -remapbil,r\", 360*(1/cell_res), \"x\", 180*(1/cell_res), \n                \" -select,name=tos \", infold, \"/\", nc_file, \" \", outfold, \"/\", nc_file))  \n  \n}\n\nfileys &lt;- list.files(paste0(pth, cmip_pth)) #list file names of downloaded ESMs\n\nw &lt;- 14 #number of workers\nplan(multisession, workers = w) # Change to multi-threaded processing\ntic(); future_walk(fileys, remap_n_crop_temp); toc() #Run the function in parallel (takes 8 sec for Jessie)\nplan(sequential) # Return to single threaded processing \n\n\nJessie speed: ~8s\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Function explainer\nFirst, the remap_n_crop_temp() function arguments:\n\nnc_file = the ESM file we downloaded from ESGF\ncell_res = the target resolution of your ESM, in degrees ˚\ninfold = the input folder where the ESM .nc files are stored (i.e., /data)\noutfold = the output folder where our processed ESM files will be stored (i.e., /processed_data/)\nxmin, xmax, ymin, ymax = the bounding box (lat/lon), of our extent encompassing the ocean off of California\n\nThe next chunk of code contained within the system() function uses CDO commands:\n\npaste0(\"cdo -L = Lock I/O (input/output read/write data sequential access)\nsellonlatbox,\" = select lon/lat box\nxmin, \",\", xmax, \",\", ymin, \",\", ymax, = boundaries of extent\n-remapbil,r\" = bilinear interpolation of the input grid (input grid MUST be curvilinear quadrilateral/spherical coordinates). Otherwise, use conservative remapping for an unstructured grid with -remapcon\n360*(1/cell_res), \"x\", 180*(1/cell_res) = adjust resolution according to rows (y) and columns (x) expected for target resolution.\n\" -select,name=tos \", = select variable name field from infile and write to outfile\ninfold, \"/\", nc_file, \" \", = input file path and file name\noutfold, \"/\", nc_file)) = output file path and file name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nCDO requires syntax (i..e, spaces and commas) to be precise. If your code doesn’t run, first check that you have them in the right places.\n\n\nRunning this chunk of code within system() sends this code to the terminal/shell, opposed to R.\nThen, we list the names of all of our input files with fileys &lt;- list.files(\"data\").\nFinally, we use a for loop to iterate our function over each input file. We use the tic() and toc() functions from tictoc() to time how long our code takes to run. In my case, this takes ~30 seconds across the six files. R will outputs the following message after each iteration: # cdo(1) remapbil: Bilinear weights from curvilinear (360x300) to lonlat (1440x720) grid, with source mask (69782) - this is normal!",

The output is saved as tmp1.nc. We then get the variable name from the file, which will be the original name of the file, e.g., tos_mo_ACCESS-CM2_2015-2100_anom_ssp245.\n\n  cdo_code &lt;- paste0('ncatted -O -a units,longitude,c,c,\"degrees_east\" -a units,latitude,c,c,\"degrees_north\" ',\n                     f, \" \", paste0(output_folder, \"/tmp1.nc\"))\n  system(cdo_code)\n  \n  rr &lt;- rast(paste0(output_folder, \"/tmp1.nc\"))\n  vary &lt;- varnames(rr)\n\n\n\n5.7.3 Remove lon/lat attributes\nThis code removes the grid_mapping attribute from the variable(s) specified in vary, and save the output as tmp2.nc.\n\n  cdo_code2 &lt;- paste0('ncatted -O -a grid_mapping,', vary, ',d,, ', \n                       paste0(output_folder, \"/tmp1.nc\"), ' ', \n                       paste0(output_folder, \"/tmp2.nc\"))\n  system(cdo_code2)\n\n\n\n5.7.4 Remapping\nHere, we remap the ESM anomalies with the OISST mask msk using bilinear interpolation, and set missing values to nearest neighbor.

We then set up our session to run in parallel, where I (Jessie) have set to 14 workers (you will need to change this to suit your machine). We then run the do_regrid() function in parallel using future_walk. Once the function has finished running, we set our session back to normal (i.e., sequential) processing.\n\nfiles &lt;- list.files(input_folder, pattern = \"anom\", full.names = TRUE) # Files to process\n plan(multisession, workers = 14) # Setting up to run in parallel, change workers to suit your machine \n tic(); furrr::future_walk(files, do_regrid); toc() #Jessie: 5.7 seconds\n plan(sequential) # Go back to sequential processing\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow left, we see the ESM anomalies created in Step 5, where we subtracted the ESM climatology (1995-2014) from the projections (2015-2100). On the right is the output of this step, representing the remapped anomalies using the OISST mask.

The adjustment to the projection for each time step in the time series amounts to the difference between the means of the observations and ESM outputs over the baseline period – hence the name “delta-change”.\n\n\nCode\ninput_folder &lt;- paste0(pth, bc_esm_pth)\nobs &lt;- paste0(pth, bc_pth, \"/_2_OISST_climatology.nc\")\n\n# Function ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\ndo_add_clim &lt;- function(f) {\n  \n  output_file &lt;- basename(f) %&gt;%  \n    gsub(\"_anom_\", \"_bc_\", .) %&gt;% # Replace anom code in file name with a code for bias corrected (bc)\n    paste0(input_folder, \"/_4_bias_corrected/\", .) # Include the path\n  \n  cdo_code &lt;- paste0(\"cdo -s -L -f nc4 -z zip \", # Zip the file up\n                     \"-add \", f, \" \", # To the remapped regridded anomalies, add...\n                     obs, \" \", output_file) # The observed climatology (map of means)\n  system(cdo_code)\n}\n\n#  Run function ------------------------------------------------------------\n\nfiles &lt;- list.files(paste0(input_folder, \"/_3_anomalies_remapped\"), \n                    pattern = \"remapped\", full.names = TRUE) # The files we want to process\ntic(); walk(files, do_add_clim); toc() \n\n\n\nJessie speed: ~1s\n\nThis results in bias-corrected fields of ocean surface temperature for each month from 2015-2100, for both ESMs and climate scenarios, such as the below field for January 2015 for ACCESS-CM2 SSP-2.45.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\n\ninput_folder &lt;- paste0(pth, \"/__data/bias_correct/esm\")\n\nrr &lt;- rast(paste0(input_folder, \"/_4_bias_corrected/tos_mo_ACCESS-CM2_2015-2100_bc_ssp245_remapped.nc\"))[[1]]\nplot(rr, main = \"Bias corrected w/OISST clim\")\nmaps::map(\"world\", add = T)\n\ntt &lt;- rast(paste0(pth, cmip_pth_proc, \"/tos_Omon_ACCESS-CM2_ssp245_r1i1p1f1_gn_201501-210012.nc\"))[[1]]\nplot(tt, main = \"Raw ESM\")\nmaps::map(\"world\", add = T)\n\nrr &lt;- rast(paste0(pth, bc_esm_pth,  \"/_3_anomalies_remapped/tos_mo_ACCESS-CM2_2015-2100_anom_ssp245_remapped.nc\"))[[1]]  \nplot(rr, col = viridis::magma(255), main = \"Remapped anomalies w/OISST\")\nmaps::map(\"world\", add = T)\n\nrr &lt;- rast(paste0(pth, bc_esm_pth, \"/_2_anomalies/tos_mo_ACCESS-CM2_2015-2100_anom_ssp245.nc\"))[[1]]\nplot(rr, col = viridis::magma(255), main = \"Anomalies Raw ESM\")\nmaps::map(\"world\", add = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove: All fields represent January 2015 for ACCESS-CM2 SSP-2.45.

IPSL does slightly worse at around 75%. However, the bias-corrected ensemble average of the two models (i.e., black triangle) plots directly on top of our observations, with almost a 1:1 correlation, meaning it does really well at simulating reality, at least for 1995-2014!

In this scenario, we can see the ocean off California is projected to increase by ~1˚C in the near-term, and ~4.5˚C in the long-term, compared to baseline SST (note the increased uncertainty, particularly in SoCal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoohoo! We’ve made SST projections for the California region using an ensemble of two ESMs, across two time periods, and, for two climate scenarios. Now, we could use these projections for species distribution modelling, marine disease projections… the list is endless! Some useful summary papers that have used ESMs to assess the impact of climate on marine fauna include (Stock et al. 2011) and (Drenkard et al. 2021).",
